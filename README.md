# PCB-Designing-by-KiCad
I am currently working with KiCad, an open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tool, to develop proficiency in PCB (Printed Circuit Board) design. My workflow involves schematic capture using KiCad's Eeschema module, component footprint assignment through CvPcb, and board layout in the PCB Editor.
