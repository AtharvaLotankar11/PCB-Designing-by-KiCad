<h1 align="center">PCB Designing with KiCad</h1>

<p>
  KiCad is a powerful, open-source software suite for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). It allows users to create schematic diagrams and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) layouts for electronic projects. With an intuitive interface and extensive library support, KiCad is a go-to tool for engineers and hobbyists alike to bring hardware ideas to life.

  One of the featured projects is a <strong>Piano Project</strong>, a simple touch-activated electronic piano circuit. The design was drafted in KiCad using custom footprints for capacitive touch sensors, logic gates, and audio output. Schematic capture and precise routing made it possible to convert the concept into a compact, functional PCB layout ready for fabrication.

  Another exciting design is a <strong>Buck Converter</strong> â€” a DC-DC converter used to step down voltage efficiently. Using KiCad, the circuit schematic was created with MOSFETs, inductors, and control ICs, followed by a well-optimized PCB layout. KiCad's simulation and 3D viewer helped validate and visualize the final board before prototyping.
