<h1 align="center">ðŸ“˜ PCB Designing with KiCad</h1>

<p>
KiCad is a free and open-source software suite for Electronic Design Automation (EDA). It allows users to design schematics, create PCB layouts, generate manufacturing files, and even perform 3D rendering of their boards. Used by professionals and hobbyists alike, KiCad provides powerful tools to bring electronic circuit ideas to life. From drawing basic schematics to routing complex multi-layer PCBs, it supports the complete workflow of hardware development. Its community-driven development model ensures regular updates, plugin support, and access to extensive libraries. Whether you're building a hobby project or prototyping for a product, KiCad equips you with everything you need to take your design from concept to fabrication.

One of the standout projects developed using KiCad is the <strong>Piano Project</strong> â€“ a simple, touch-based musical instrument powered by a microcontroller. This mini piano allows users to press touch sensors (like capacitive buttons) to play different musical notes. The design process in KiCad began with creating a schematic that included touch pads, a microcontroller (like an ATmega or ESP32), and a piezo speaker. After completing the schematic, component footprints were assigned, followed by PCB layout where touch areas were designed with large copper pours. Routing was done carefully to avoid interference, especially in analog paths. KiCadâ€™s 3D viewer helped visualize the board and refine component placement. This project demonstrates how KiCad is perfect for prototyping interactive, compact electronic devices.

Another practical design made in KiCad is the <strong>Buck Converter</strong> â€“ a DC-DC converter that steps down voltage efficiently using inductors, capacitors, and switching elements. It is widely used in power supply units, especially where battery power needs to be regulated. In this design, the process started by drawing a circuit with a switching regulator IC, external passive components, and input/output headers. Special attention was given to component values and power traces. After schematic capture, the board was laid out in KiCadâ€™s PCB Editor, emphasizing current flow paths and thermal reliefs. Components like inductors and large capacitors were strategically placed to reduce noise and improve efficiency. KiCadâ€™s DRC (Design Rule Check) helped verify the layout integrity before export. The result is a compact, effective step-down converter ready for fabrication and testing.
